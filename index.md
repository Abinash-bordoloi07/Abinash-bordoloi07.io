### Project 1: Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
               
               
  - Done this projectto to solve a real-world data science problem using real-world Netflix movie dataset. 
  - You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time.
  - And which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office". 
  - Using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

### Project 2: The Android App Market on Google Play
   Mobile apps are everywhere.They are easy to create and can be lucrative. Because of these two factors, more and more apps are being developed. 
   In this project, you will do a comprehensive analysis of the Android app market by comparing over ten thousand apps in Google Play across different categories. 
   You'll look for insights in the data to devise strategies to drive growth and retention. The data for this project was scraped from the Google Play website. 
   While there are many popular datasets for Apple App Store, there aren't many for Google Play apps, which is partially due to the increased difficulty 
   in scraping the latter as compared to the former. 
   
   The data files are as follows:

   - apps.csv: contains all the details of the apps on Google Play. These are the features that describe an app.
   - user_reviews.csv: contains 100 reviews for each 
     app, most helpful first. The text in each review has been pre-processed, passed through a sentiment analyzer engine 
     and tagged with its sentiment score.
     
 ### Project 2: The GitHub History of the Scala Language
   Open source projects contain entire development histories, such as who made changes, the changes themselves, and code reviews. 
   In this project, you'll be challenged to read in, clean up, and visualize the real-world project repository of Scala that spans data 
   from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). 
   With almost 30,000 commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature language. 
   You will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.

   The dataset includes the project history of [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) retrieved from Git and GitHub as a set of CSV files.
